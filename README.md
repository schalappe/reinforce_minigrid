# MiniGrid

MiniGrid contains a collection of 2D grid-world environments with goal-oriented tasks. The agent in these
environments is a triangle-like agent with a discrete action space. The tasks involve solving different maze maps and
interacting with different objects such as doors, keys, or boxes. The design of the library is meant to be simple,
fast, and easily customizable.
